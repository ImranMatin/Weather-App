                <p>Hiring and getting hired for product management roles is hard. In the short timeframe of an interview, it is difficult to precisely assess and display the necessary, complex skills.
                    Product Managers play key roles in a company. Hiring for those positions shouldnâ€˜t be a guessing game.
                    
                    It is our vision, to make it simple and beneficial for Product Managers to accurately display their skills and empower hiring companies to choose the right Product Manager every time.</p>
